# Angular-Project-FoodBlog
Recipe Blog is a web application for sharing and managing food recipes.

The types of users:
* Registered users - they can add, save and like recipes.
* Guest users - they can login, register and browse through the recipes, but cannot interact with them.
* Everyone can see the details about a certain recipe.

For back-end the app uses a modified by me rest-api from SoftUni Angular course - november 2022.
